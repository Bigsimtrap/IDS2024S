1. See the PDF file in the same folder
2. ENIAC means electroncial numerical integrator and comuter
3. Everything is represented by integers incomputers because of the simplicity to represent data with just 0 and 1.
4. Cache is the fastest part of the computer memory
5. DISK is the slowest part of the computer memory
6. Bit is the smallest unit of information in computer science
7. Assembly language is closely related to machine code (B) Assmebly language does require an assembler to interpret the code for computer hardware
8. Fortran is the oldest- high level programming languae that is still in active use and was created in the 1950's.
9. Assembler languages would be considered a second generation programming language (B) C,C++, MATLAB, Python, R are all third generation programming languages
10. C was created in the 1970's, C++ was created in the 1990's, and Python was developed in the 1990's.
11. B was an ancestor to C programming language
12. C was an ancestor to C++
13. ABC was an ancestor of Python
14. Registers are the fastest part in the memory hierarchy of modern computers
15. Registers are also the smallest part in the memory hierarchy of modern computers
16. Register memory is 100ns faster than RAM
17. RAM is 100ms faster than SSD hardrive

19. The role of transistors switches in computers is to control or amplify an electric current.
20. Adding more trasistors would make the circuits features so small that they would affect their magnetic field causing the electrons to move into other parts of the circuit.
21. The three taks accomlished with a CPU is to fetch, decode and execute.
22. A powerful computer with a higher CPU cycle can be slower than a computer with less CPU cycle because the clock speed in the computer with less CPU can be faster than the computer with a high CPU cycle because the faster clock speed deals with information more effeciently.
23. The bottleneck of speed is the memory acces bacause it can cause the computer to jam and run slower with all the information given to it.
24. The difference between Dennard scaling is that it implies that the more transistors we can fit on an Integrated Citcuit, the faster it will become, while the Moore's Law sates that the number of trsnsistor count in microprocessors doubles every two years.
25. (1)You would need to put 64 grains in the 64th square.(2)You would need 2080 grains to fill (1) 1.0e64 is how many grains you would need in the 64th square.
