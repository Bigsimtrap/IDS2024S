1.
2. Aesthetics are data values turned into quantifiable features
3. The purple and green color paletes is more appropriate because the red to green paletted is difficult to read for people that have color blindness.
4. a- This color scale is good for discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order such as different countries on a map
   b- The blue brew color scale is used to represent values such as temperature, speed, or income as goes from light to dark
   c- The diverging colors scale can be used to deviate different data values in one of two directions relative to a midpoint
   d- Highlighted or accented color scales can be use to high specific values that stand out from the rest othe chart
5. 
6. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation. An example of this would be that there is a higher chance that
it might rain if it is cloudy, but that doesn't mean it will always rain when its cloudy.
7. a- I do not think the red line is a good fit because it does not even cover all of the temperatures in the past centuries.
   b- The uncertatinty is that before the world war and industrial revolution, we wouldnt know if the temperature would stay the same of be in affected
   c- This is a positive correlation
   d- This is a time series dataset because it is a series of observations that are sequentially ordered.
   5. .96 is the average
   8. Bayesian Theory allows for prior knowledge in scientific inference
   9. Classical Probability is the most useful when data is scarce
   10. Frequentist Probability cannot conclude that God exist because we cannot use prior knowledge to prove his existence.
   11. The problem with this visual is that nobody can be born a number below zero.
   12. Everything is represented in integers because if something is true, there must be a false to oppose it. For example,
   the light switch is either on or off (0 and 1).
   13. An ancestor to C language would be B language
   14. Fortran was the first high level programming language in history
   15. 
   16. 
   17. Inductive reasoning is based on assumption from prior knowledge. (e.g. wearing a coat if its predicted to snow)
   An example of deductive reasoning would be my birthday is August 31st, therefore August 31st is the day my birthday will always fall on
   18. No we can not represent all real numbers because a computer has limited storage to preocess big numbers
   19. The value of S is 3 since the pattern counts from 3, 6, 9...93+96+99
