1. Aesthetics are data values converted into quantifiable features of a resulting graphic.
2. The two major classes of aesthetics are continuous and discreted data values
3. The two types of aesthetics are quantitative and qualitative data. An example of quantitative data are numerical values like 1,2,3.

7. AN
8. Describing the rise and fall of temperature, making the x axes more narrow would result in a better visualization
9. All three coordinate systems are valid and can be used to represent data
10. Datasets on daily temperature would be best for polar coordinates
11. Diverging color scales would be best for deviating data values in one of two directions relative to neutral midpoint.
Highlighting would be best for emphazising a specifif data value.
Accent color scales would be good for making a data value stand out from the rest by presenting a more darker color compared to
lighter colors
12. The problem with this visual is that no one be an age that is a negative number.
13. The red and green olor palettes is not appropraite for people that are colorblind. The purple to green palette is
