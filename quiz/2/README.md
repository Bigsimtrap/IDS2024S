1. RAM is the fastest component of computer memory
2. A modern computer is composed of a hierarchy because it allows the CPU to predict and prefetch the future data from the slow and larger levels to the higher but smaller levelsfor usage by the CPU for computations.
3. Disk is the slowest kind of computer storage device.
4. Disk, DRAM, L3 cache, L2 cache, L1 cache, Registers
5. Bit is the smallest unit of information in computers,
6. Humans have chosen 0 and 1 to represent data in computers because they are easy to represent electronically.
7. The typical speed for registers are <ns
8. 1940s was the decade when the first computer was built.
9. 
10. A fixed program computer is a computer that already comes with a set of instruction to complete a repeated task.
11. An ATM  would be considered a modern fixed program computer.
12. Declarative knowledge involvrs a statement of fact, while imperative knowledge is about how to accomplish something.
13. (a) Declarative (b) Declarative (c) Imparative (d) Imparative (e) Imparative
14. Imparative knowledge could be classified as algorithm
15. ENIAC was the first digita
16. Python can be used for bioinformatics
17. Fortran is widely used in the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Science, and Aerospace Engineering
18. Input, CPU, Output, Main memory, Storage peripherals are the main components of a modern day computer
19. A calculator would be considered a fixed programming computer
20. Fortran (1954), Cobol (1959), B (1969), C++ (1983), Python (1991)
21. Assembly language is the closest human readable language to machine code. This language does need interpretation to become machine comprehesible.
22. Fortran is the oldest high level program that is still in active use. It was created in the 1950's
23. The second generation programming language is Assembly. (b) Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, and R are all third generation programming languages
24. 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's were when the third generation programming languages were created.
25. B language is an ancestor to C language
26. C with classes is an ancestor to C language
27. ABC was an ancestor to Python programming language
28. Logarithm is an expression to solve an equation by using the base to the 10th power.
29. 45 is the value of S. I created two line from (3,6,9...93,96,99) (99,96,93,9,6,3) the answer was 90 for all three and then i divided 90 by 2 since I had two lines.
