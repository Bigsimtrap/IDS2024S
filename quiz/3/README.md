1. Discovering a natural phenomena with observational data, realize the inverse problem. The next step would be
to calibrate and validate the problem so it can be formed into a plausible predicition
2. The three pillars of science are reality, scenario, and data
 3. We examine a scenario by using data we have computed from reality. However, we could use reality to come up with a plausible scenario from data.
4. An example of deductive reasoning would be it is always cold outside when it's snowing. If it is not cold then it will not snow.An example of plausible reasoning would be A. It will start to rain at 3pm at the lastest. B. Expect clouds at 3 pm
5. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation. If that were the case then snow would always be the cause of cold weather
which is not always true. However it is  more plausible that there is a higher chance of snow when the temperature is colder.
6. Boolean algebra is named after George Boole
7. See venn diagram
8. See venn diagram
9. If two Booleans propositions were equal, they have the same truth value that are equally plausible
10. See vinn diagram

16. f1(A,B)+f3(*A,B)+f4(*A,*B) *=false
17.    
18. I don't believe this was a fair quiz simply because pictures were needed to answer questions and I feel it would have been better to
19. ask for scenarios for the logic implication questions
