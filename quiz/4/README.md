1. The four definitions of probabiltiy are degree of belief, prior knowledge, relative frequency of occurence, and the data that is present
2. Classical and Bayesian Probabilty
3. Bayesian Probability
4. Frequentist Probability
5. Richard Cox is prominent in the Bayesian Theory and Abraham Wald is prominent is the Frequentist Theory
6. The range of a probabilty value is determined by how many possible outcomes there is paired with common sense and prior knowledge.

11. A'+B'='AB'
